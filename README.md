# cargo-workspaces

> Archived, see [miraclx/cargo-workspaces](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces) for the live version.

Fork of [pksunkara/cargo-workspaces](https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces), maintained by [miraclx](https://github.com/miraclx).

Differences from the upstream repo:

- Allows definition of package versions in the workspace manifest to avoid prompting.
- Properly supports workspace inheritance.
- Introduces package groups which allows for versioning and publishing of only a subset of crates in a workspace.
- Auto-injection of missing inter-dependency versions.
- Works on non-git workspaces.
- Properly discriminates between local and public crates when updating the manifest. (<https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces/issues/94>)
- Allows for the exclusion of crates from being versioned and published.
- When versioning and publishing, tags are only applied after crates have been successful published.
- Reduces the likelihood of surprising git errors when validating, committing or tagging.

For an example what using this utility for versioning looks like, see [these examples](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces/compare/daa00d4..aad6056):

- [Workspace Inheritance.](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces/commit/bff6ceb6184a0234e2d077c0fc468aa59b1194bd)
- [Crate Conflict.](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces/commit/aad6056ae1fda817225f299d0b6e8099fa4b8125)
- [Root Package Self Inheritance.](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces/commit/e237e3171a2935c64e3f34428d1be8b502b4b816)

Inspired by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).

A tool that optimizes the workflow around cargo workspaces with `git` and `cargo` by providing utilities to
version, publish, execute commands and more.

I made this to work on [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) and other projects that rely on workspaces.
But this will also work on single crates because by default every individual crate is a workspace.

## Installation

```console
cargo install --git https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces cargo-workspaces
```

## Usage

The installed tool can be called by `cargo workspaces` or `cargo ws`. Both of them point to the same.

You can use `cargo ws help` or `cargo ws help <subcmd>` anytime to understand allowed options.

The basic commands available for this tool are given below. Assuming you run them inside a cargo workspace.

### Init

Initializes a new cargo workspace in the given directory. Creates `Cargo.toml` if it does not exist and
fills the `members` with the all the crates that can be found in that directory.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces init [PATH]

ARGS:
    <PATH>    Path to the workspace root [default: .]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help    Print help information
```

### Create

Interactively creates a new crate in the workspace. *We recommend using this instead of `cargo new`*. All
the crates start with `0.0.0` version because the [version](#version) is responsible for determining the
version.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces create [OPTIONS] <PATH>

ARGS:
    <PATH>    Path for the crate relative to the workspace manifest

OPTIONS:
        --bin                  Whether this is a binary crate
        --edition <EDITION>    The crate edition [possible values: 2015, 2018, 2021]
    -h, --help                 Print help information
        --lib                  Whether this is a library crate
        --name <NAME>          The name of the crate
```

### List

Lists crates in the workspace.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces list [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -a, --all                Show private crates that are normally hidden
        --groups <GROUPS>    Comma separated list of crate groups to deal with
    -h, --help               Print help information
        --json               Show information as a JSON array
    -l, --long               Show extended information
```

Several aliases are available.

- `cargo ws ls` implies `cargo ws list`
- `cargo ws ll` implies `cargo ws list --long`
- `cargo ws la` implies `cargo ws list --all`

### Changed

List crates that have changed since the last git tag. This is useful to see the list of crates that
would be the subjects of the next [version](#version) or [publish](#publish) command.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces changed [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -a, --all                         Show private crates that are normally hidden
        --force <pattern>             Always include targeted crates matched by glob even when there are no changes
        --groups <GROUPS>             Comma separated list of crate groups to deal with
    -h, --help                        Print help information
        --ignore-changes <pattern>    Ignore changes in files matched by glob
        --include-merged-tags         Include tags from merged branches
        --json                        Show information as a JSON array
    -l, --long                        Show extended information
        --since <SINCE>               Use this git reference instead of the last tag
```

### Exec

Executes an arbitrary command in each crate of the workspace.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces exec [OPTIONS] <ARGS>...

ARGS:
    <ARGS>...

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
        --no-bail    Continue executing command despite non-zero exit in a given crate
```

For example, if you want to run `ls -l` in each crate, you can simply do `cargo ws exec ls -l`.

### Version

Bump versions of the crates in the workspace. This command does the following:

1. Identifies crates that have been updated since the previous tagged release
2. Prompts for a new version according to the crate
3. Modifies crate manifest to reflect new release
4. Update intra-workspace dependency version constraints if needed
5. Commits those changes
6. Tags the commit
7. Pushes to the git remote

You can influence the above steps with the flags and options for this command.

```console
USAGE:
    cargo workspaces version [OPTIONS] [--] [ARGS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help    Print help information

VERSION ARGS:
    <BUMP>      Increment all versions by the given explicit semver keyword while skipping the prompts for them
                [possible values: major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor, prepatch, prerelease, custom]
    <CUSTOM>    Specify custom version value when 'bump' is set to 'custom'

VERSION OPTIONS:
    -a, --all                         Also do versioning for private crates (will not be published)
        --exact                       Specify inter dependency version numbers exactly with `=`
        --force <pattern>             Always include targeted crates matched by glob even when there are no changes
        --groups <GROUPS>             Comma separated list of crate groups to version
        --ignore-changes <pattern>    Ignore changes in files matched by glob
        --include-merged-tags         Include tags from merged branches
        --no-pager                    Do not use a pager for previewing package groups in interactive mode
        --pre-id <identifier>         Specify prerelease identifier
    -y, --yes                         Skip confirmation prompt

GIT OPTIONS:
        --allow-branch <pattern>            Specify which branches to allow from [default: master]
        --amend                             Amend the existing commit, instead of generating a new one
        --git-remote <remote>               Push git changes to the specified remote [default: origin]
        --individual-tag-msg <msg>          Customize tag msg for individual tags, defaults to individual tag name (can contain `%n` and `%v`)
        --individual-tag-prefix <prefix>    Customize prefix for individual tags (should contain `%n`) [default: %n@]
    -m, --message <MESSAGE>                 Use a custom commit message when creating the version commit [default: Release %v]
        --no-git                            Do not perform any git operations (implies --no-git-commit and --no-git-tag)
        --no-git-commit                     Do not commit version changes, omitting this will tag the current commit
        --no-git-push                       Do not push generated commit and tags to git remote
        --no-git-tag                        Do not tag generated commit (implies --no-individual-tags and --no-global-tag)
        --no-global-tag                     Do not create a global tag for a workspace
        --no-individual-tags                Do not tag individual versions for crates
        --tag-msg <msg>                     Customize tag msg, defaults to tag name (can contain `%v`)
        --tag-prefix <prefix>               Customize tag prefix for global tags (can be empty) [default: v]
        --tag-private                       Also tag individual versions of private packages
```

#### Fixed or Independent

By default, all the crates in the workspace will share a single version. But if you want the crate to have
it's version be independent of the other crates, you can add the following to that crate:

```toml
[package.metadata.workspaces]
independent = true
```

If you want groups of crates to share a single version, independent of the rest of the workspace, see [Groups and Grouping](#groups-and-grouping).

For more details, check [Config](#config) section below.

#### Exclusion

To have crates opt-out from being versioned, you can add the following to the workspace:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.workspaces]
exclude = [
    "./crates/*",
    "path/to/some/specific/crate",
]
```

For more details, check [Config](#config) section below.

#### Groups and Grouping

Use this to group certain crates together and have them share a single version that is independent from the rest of workspace.

This also lets you choose to version and publish only a specific subset of crates in the workspace<sup>[1](#groups-and-grouping-1)</sup> instead of all at once.
As well as visualizing [changes](#changed) by group or [listing](#list) crates on a per-group basis.

<sup id="groups-and-grouping-1"><sup>1</sup> If a crate from outside a group depends on crates within the group that is versioned, their versions are bumped too.</sup>

To create groups, add the following to the workspace:

```toml
[[workspace.metadata.workspaces.group]]
name = "foobar"
members = [
    "./foo",
    "./bar/*",
]

[[workspace.metadata.workspaces.group]]
name = "another-group"
members = [ "crates/*" ]
```

> Note that group membership is exclusive, a crate isn't allowed to be a part of multiple groups.
> Also, the `default` group name is reserved for crates that don't belong to any group.
> And, the `excluded` group name is reserved for crates that are marked to be [excluded](#exclusion) from being versioned.

For more details, check [Config](#config) section below.

### Publish

Publish all the crates from the workspace in the correct order according to the dependencies. By default,
this command runs [version](#version) first. If you do not want that to happen, you can supply the
`--from-git` option.

> Note: dev-dependencies are not taken into account when building the dependency
> graph used to determine the proper publishing order. This is because
> dev-dependencies are ignored by `cargo publish` - as such, a dev-dependency on a
> local crate (with a `path` attribute), should *not* have a `version` field.

```

## Config

There are two kinds of configuration options.

- **Workspace**: Options that are specified in the workspace with `[workspace.metadata.workspaces]`
- **Package**: Options that are specified in the package with `[package.metadata.workspaces]`

### Package Configuration

```toml
[package.metadata.workspaces]
independent = false  # This package should be versioned independently from the rest
```

### Workspace Configuration

```toml
[workspace.metadata.workspaces]
version = "0.1.0"                       # Version for this workspace, to avoid prompting
allow_branch = "master"                 # Specify which branches to allow from [default: master]
no_individual_tags = false              # Do not tag individual versions for crates
exclude = [ "./foo", "./bar/*" ]        # List of crates to exclude from actions

[[workspace.metadata.workspaces.group]]
name = "utils"                          # Name for this group
version = "0.1.0"                       # Version for this group, to avoid prompting
members = [ "./utils/a", "./utils/b" ]  # Member crates belonging to this group
